# Xojo Demo of NSApplication / setActivationPolicy
 
Apps that always run as an accessory (ie: with no menu bar or dock icon) are simple enough: just an additional entry in the Info.plist file.

See https://github.com/charlierobin/Xojo-LSUIElement for an example.

If you want to be a bit more showy and allow the user / app to switch between the two policies, ie: running as an accessory or running regular, then you have to jump through a couple more hoops.

This is a very simple demo project to get you started.
